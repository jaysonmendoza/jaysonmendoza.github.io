I gained practical knowledge of artificial intelligence, including how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT function, and how to responsibly and effectively use them in professional settings. Through real-world examples and guided instruction, I explored the use of Gen AI as a tool to complete tasks, a teammate to support problem-solving, and a tutor to guide rapid skill acquisition. Professional skills I mastered include designing effective prompts, evaluating AI-generated content critically, integrating AI into workplace tasks, and understanding how AI is shaping the future of work.
