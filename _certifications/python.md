I gained hands-on experience doing professional-level data analysis utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Working with large, real-world data sets, I investigated business problems and made data-driven recommendations to inform business decisions. Technical skills I mastered include programming fundamentals, visualizing data with the Plotly library, Pandas functions and methods, grouping and aggregating data. Professional skills I mastered include communicating with data, understanding business metrics, and collaborating with a global team.
