title: Smart pH Monitoring System
description: A chemical tank required a durable, compact housing for a pH sensor to operate reliably in a corrosive environment. The enclosure was designed in SolidWorks to fit within tight spatial limits while maintaining precise sensor alignment. GD&T was applied to control critical features and ensure consistency during production and assembly. Material selection prioritized corrosion resistance and structural integrity in aqueous chemical conditions. FEA simulations and lab testing were used to validate performance under mechanical load and thermal variation.
