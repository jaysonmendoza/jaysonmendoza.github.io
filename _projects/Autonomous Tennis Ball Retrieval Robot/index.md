title: Autonomous Tennis Ball Retrieval Robot
description: A mechanical system engineered to autonomously catch a free-falling tennis ball and deliver it six feet into a tray within 30 seconds. Built under strict design constraints, it uses a single input to activate, operates without human contact during motion, and adheres to rules prohibiting non-engineering materials, kit-based components, and temporary fasteners. The system was developed using CAD modeling, simulation, and digital manufacturing, with custom parts designed to proper tolerancing and GD&T standards for accurate fit and function. All components were fabricated using approved methods such as 3D printing to ensure compliance and reliability.
